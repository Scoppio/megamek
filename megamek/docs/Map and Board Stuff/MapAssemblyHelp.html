<H2> Ground and Atmospheric Maps</H2>
A ground map or atmospheric map is constructed of one or more boards. All boards of the TWGame map must be the same size but that size can be chosen freely.
<P>The setup of the TWGame map can be saved and loaded using the buttons below the map preview.
<P>To assemble a ground or atmospheric map, select the width and height of the map, i.e. the number of boards that make up the TWGame map. Then select the board size you want to use from the list of available board sizes. You can choose "Custom Size" and set the board size manually.
<P>By default, each board of the TWGame map is a generated board. Generated boards use settings that can be viewed or changed in the dialog reached by the "Generated Map Settings" button to create a board when the TWGame starts. If you want to use a specific board from the list of available boards on the right, drag that board to the map preview. You can also use the right-click menu to assign boards. Boards can also be re-arranged in the map preview via drag-and-drop.
<P>You can select and drag multiple boards at once. In that case, a "Surprise" board will be used in the TWGame map. At the start of the TWGame, one of the selected boards will be used for the TWGame map.
<P>Note: for both generated and surprise maps, the board that the map preview shows is only an example and the board that will appear when the TWGame starts can be different.

<H2> Space Maps</H2>
<P>When you select a Space Map, the TWGame's map will be an empty space map. You can only set the size of the map.
